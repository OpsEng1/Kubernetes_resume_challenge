This is my repo for "The Kubernetes Resume Challenge" detailed at https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/extensions/kubernetes-challenge/

I've had so much fun. These are my highlights:

1. Learnt how to use Google Cloud - GKE
2. Loved playing around with Docker and how to test my Docker image is correct
3. Spent some time playing around with Liveness/Readiness probes, troubleshooting why it couldn't contact the endpoints in a timely manner
4. Of course, refreshing my memory on the wonderful world of Kubernetes after passing the CKA exam last year
